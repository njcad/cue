## The Cue App!
This repo contains code for my first little Swift project, **Cue Goals**, a simple goal-tracking app. You can download the testflight version [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/FVRXtKKf).

## What does it do?
Enter your daily goals. Track them each day by marking as complete. Over time, see your streak grow.

Right now (12 February 2026), it's a _very_ simple app that lives entirely on a client device. There is no external database or backend, no account creation, no special features. It downloads and runs quickly and smoothly to just get the job done (that is, to help you get your daily goals done).

Although this is mainly just a fun demo project, part of the goal here is to focus on simple, zero-distraction, elegant and beautiful design. My goal is to make it _feel_ good to use.

## Where will it go?
The original idea for Cue comes from an insight about actually hitting personal goals: social accountability. It's easy to neglect your own personal goals. What if they became superpersonal? That is, if they were embedded in community?

This is where I want to take Cue. I want to build a system that uses our community to help each other hit our goals. Imagine if your friends and families could nudge you to, for instance, remember to stretch today, or if you could congratulate your friend for hitting their 30 minutes of reading today. 

This social motivation is where I'd like to go next. Check in soon...
